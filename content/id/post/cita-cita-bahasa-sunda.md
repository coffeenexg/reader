With its distinct rhythms and melodious tones, Bahasa Sunda represents the rich tapestry of Sundanese history and culture. From the rolling hills of Puncak Pass to the vibrant markets of Bandung, the language echoes through the voices of the Sundanese people, connecting them to their roots.

Preserving Heritage

Imagine a classroom filled with eager young minds, their voices filled with the rhythm and melody of Bahasa Sunda. Through interactive lessons and engaging activities, students can develop a deep appreciation for the language and its cultural significance.

An important aspect of "Cita Cita Bahasa Sunda" is also the encouragement of creative expression. Sundanese literature and poetry have a rich history, filled with tales of heroism, love, and spirituality. By providing platforms for aspiring writers and poets, we can ensure the continuation of this literary tradition.

Revitalizing the Language

Language is alive, and it evolves with time. To ensure the continued relevance and vibrancy of Bahasa Sunda, it is crucial to adapt it to the modern world. This includes the creation of new vocabulary and the integration of Sundanese into digital platforms.

Imagine a vibrant online community where Sundanese speakers from all over the world can connect, share, and celebrate their language. Through websites, social media platforms, and digital applications, we can create a space where Bahasa Sunda thrives in the digital age.
